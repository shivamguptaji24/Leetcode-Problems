Daily Question :
763 - Partition Labels

You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts. 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] lastIndex = new int[26];  // Stores the last index of each character

        // Step 1: Store the last occurrence of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            lastIndex[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }

        // Step 2: Traverse the string and form partitions
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            end = Math.max(end, lastIndex[s.charAt(i) - 'a']); // Update end to the farthest occurrence of any character in the current partition
            if (i == end) { // If current index reaches the end, partition ends
                result.add(end - start + 1);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
